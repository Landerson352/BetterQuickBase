BetterQuickBase
===============

After installing this user script, your Quickbase "Add Time Card" screen will:

- Remember your last project, date, and summary selected and prepopulate it on the next card.
- Display a link to revert the date to "today" with one click.
- Display a preset list of quick-fill summaries common to a Scrum workplace.
- Allow you to add more custom quick-fills to the list. 

The design and layout will also be changed so that:
- Unnecessary fields are hidden, such as "Team Member" and "Task". (Sorry if you actually use these.)
- Accordions are removed and the whole form is always visible.
- Long-winded, all-caps labels are shortened.
- The form field sizes are more closely aligned visually.
